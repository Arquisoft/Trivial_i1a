		<h2>Main objective</h2>
		<p>The object of the game is to move around the board by correctly answering some questions.</p>
		<h2>Categories</h2>
		<p>Questions are split into six categories, each one of them identified by a different colour.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Green: Science and Technologies</li>
			<li>Blue: Geography</li>
			<li>Yellow: History</li>
			<li>Brown: Art and Literature</li>
			<li>Orange: Sports and hobbies</li>
			<li>Pink: Shows</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>How to play</h2>
		<p>During the game, players move their playing pieces around a track which is shaped like a wheel with six spokes. This track is divided into spaces of different colors, and the center of the board is a hexagonal "hub" space. At the end of each spoke is a "category headquarters" space. When a player's counter lands on a square, the player answers a question according to the color of the square, which corresponds to one of the six categories. If the player answers the question correctly, their turn continues; if the player's piece was on one of the category headquarters spaces, he/she collect a wedge of the same color.
		Some spaces say "roll again," giving an extra roll of the die to the player. The hub is a "wild" space; a player landing here may answer a question in the category of his/her choice. Any number of playing pieces may occupy the same space at the same time. A variant rule ends a player's turn on collecting a wedge, preventing a single knowledgeable player from running the board.</p>
		<h2>End of the game</h2>
		<p>Once a player has collected one wedge of each color, he or she must return to the hub and answer a question in a category selected by the other players. If this question is answered correctly, that player wins the game. Otherwise, the player must leave the center of the board and try again on the next turn.</p>
